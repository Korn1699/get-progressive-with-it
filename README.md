# Get Progressive with it

__*Note: I am working on cleaning up the backend and client apps for this workshop, but they are
orthagonal to the code we will be working on. Please check back soon for updates.*__

We will be turning a relatively simple  Todo application into a fully featured PWA. The majority of
our code will be working on developing a Service Worker capable of supporting the application.

## Prerequisites

This workshop will provide a Docker configuration to get quickly up and running, but if you don't
have docker look below to see the necessary software to run locally.

## Docker

## Without Docker
